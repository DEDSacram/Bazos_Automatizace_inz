How to use

Make sure Cookie is valid, if not replace it
First run getcrawl, set whatever item you want to get info about
If you do not have category Options run jsonfromcategories
If you want to relist you need to get additional info into the json object
Run Dicitionaryassigncategoryalone, or image version links img in the folder
add.js adds the chosen item
remove.js to be done, doesnt take that long though
